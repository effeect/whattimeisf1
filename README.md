# What time is F1
This is a website powered by FastF1 that simply displays the current race time/info, mostly did it because I was 
tired of trying to find it.

# To-Do
There are some bits and pieces that need to be done before I can say this project is complete
- Need to improve the formatting, currently using a boostrap cover template
- Tidy up the Python and seperate it out
- Make the time change depending on the timezone (Currently looking at UTC-00)
- Make GitHub Action to automate the updating of this static site
